## Practical Exercise #2: Base Map Design

#### Map 1: Tiramisu

For as long as I can remember, my mother's favorite cake has been Tiramisu. This map's color scheme serves as a small celebration of my mom and her excellent taste in cakes.

Happy Mother's Day.

#### Map 2: Ice Age

As a skier, the thought of a cold and snowy planet is pleasing to my imagination (and a little frightening). Wax up your skis - on this base map, every day is a powder day.
